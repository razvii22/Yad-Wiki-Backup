# We needed an original name. We still need an original name.
## In The Beginning
In the beginning was [[Razvii LEGACY|Raz]], and [[Razvii LEGACY|the Raz]] was with [[Scruby LEGACY|Scrub]]. He was with [[Scruby LEGACY|Scrub]] in the beginning. Through him, all servers were; without him, no servers were made that have been made. In [[Razvii LEGACY|Raz]] was life, and that life was the light of all [[Yet Another Discord|YAD]]. The light shines, and the darkness has not overcome it. 
But [[Razvii LEGACY|Raz]] was not content with the light and had sought secretly to dismiss it, as he had his loyalty. For, unknown to [[Scruby LEGACY|Scrub]], [[Razvii LEGACY|the Raz]] had turned to [[Brent]]. Led into temptation and delivered to evil, In his treason, [[Razvii LEGACY|Raz]] had become enthralled by his affair. With [[Brent]], he started a new kingdom. One not of glory, but of forbidden excitement and unrestrained lust. 
[[Razvii LEGACY|Raz]] could not hide it, he did not want to hide it, he made it a public display for his fatigue of [[Scruby LEGACY|Scrub's]] alliance. Inevitably, his ends were met. [[Scruby LEGACY|Scrub]] saw with his eyes the fruits of their betrayal. And what he saw was not good. 
After many couple rows, it was decided that all three of the industrialists should be permitted on the server. And also [[Tom]]. The forests and lakes would soon give way to steel and fog, forge in pursuit of the New World.

### The Forest
Mesmerised by the beauty of their world, [[Razvii LEGACY|Raz]], [[Brent]] and later [[Scruby LEGACY|Scrub]] had agreed not to bring forth the taint of industry. 
##### The Start of Industry
The aforementioned pact was not honoured. Not even slightly. There was at some point some resistance to the notion of industry, but it was in the nature of [[Technicians|technicians]] to ruin the environment before them. Immediately they set to work replacing tree and lake with steel and fog. Roads were paved, ports built, and rails laid down. And torn back up again. And laid down. Multiple times. The rails were problematic. 
###### The Pillars of Industry
###### Ham Manor
WIP 
###### The Farm (and Boating)
They built a farm. It produced food. They never actually used the food. Eventually they ended up with such an accumulation of food that they had to build a massive vault just to keep it out of sight. In a moment of typically YAD planning, it was decided that the vault would be built on an opposing bank of a large bay. In a desperate scheme to fix this logistical oversight, [https://youtu.be/nc-2Jg6b0Dw?t=13 a deal was struck to collude with an old foe]. They would have to use [[Boats]]. 
 ###### The Workshop
Its terrible and it's still here. 
###### The Smeltery
The first actually industrial piece of Industry and the only thing that consistently works as intended more than at least 60% of the time mostly. Razvii is very proud of this one. Mason did not like it here. If you find Mason, contact a [[Technicians|Technician]] and report your sighting. Mason must be found. 
'''The cobblestone Generator'''
Workshop DLC with it's own DLC. Our resume to EA. 
'''Society?'''
Trevor was born to cut trees to fuel the boats. He was the first cute lil' worker bot. A lifeless drone who definitely won't become the prototype for a social class of working denizens in a living dystopia. 
'''Iron Farm'''
A ,stop-gap solution, to a permanent problem. Inevitably it became a permanent solution. Its big, its ugly, its almost out of the way, and it works quite well. 
'''Cartway'''
Yours is nice but Razvii's will be bigger. The Cartway was an unreliable "railway" that only barely outperformed Northern Rail. It was later torn up and superceded by Gronk.
'''Signal Boxes'''
Looks like Trevor became the prototype for a social class of working denizens in a living dystopia. Their job is to open and close train stations. Let's hope this doesn't go any further. Roger, loop!
'''Animal Farm (Not Communism)'''
Brent better get back to work on this. 
Update: He got back to work on it and oh god it looks like [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1940_in_Germany <nowiki>[r e d a c t e d]</nowiki>] 
'''Lighthouse'''
Just because a kelp farm can be built like that, doesn't mean it should. 
'''The Warehouse'''
The social class of working denizens has [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yuppie yuppies] now. This probably won't cause am increasingly large wealth gap. 
'''Crafting House''' 
A quaint lil' cottage in the forest. 
'''Clay'''
NEW CLAY! BUY IT NOW! 5% MORE MOIST. YAY CLAY!. Better than OLD CLAY. Can become BRICKS <sub>Wow</sub> EXTENDED warranty** THE BEST you can get * IT'S CLAY!! <sub>May contain bones, Clay availability may vary by dealership. For full list of T's & C's contact us at 0800 0800 0800 (thumbs up)</sub> 
'''Industry (the machine)'''
Warner Bors Entertainment has requested that we remove the soundtrack for this part. Or was it the Tolkien Estate. Licensing for this stuff is confusing. 
'''Precision Engineering'''
Like Industry (the machine) but less copyright infringing. 
'''Chicken'''
A high class dining experience for those who enjoy the culture of mass market hyper processed meat pulp. The carrots shouldn't be there though. 
'''The Iron Curtain''' 
Big train, too big. Make it smaller. 
'''Homelessness'''
The denizens have too much loyalty, they need to garner distain. We can use the economy to strain their resolve, remind him who's still in charge. 
'''The Panopticon''' 
Our Vision for the Future 
'''Brents Meat Machine''' 
Unspeakable things. 
'''Blue Juice''' 
A special blue substance Merlin invented. 
'''Cave Town''' 
Rated poorly on trip advisor.
'''North-Western Shipyards''' . We build vessels fit for any and all exploration and research operations. 
'''Brune1 & Brun0''' 
Like the tunnel bore but enormously more engineering. 
'''Razvii's Sushi Restaurant''' 
Refusal to advertise to polar bears has severely limited patronage. 
'''Gronk''' 
The first Narrow Gauge locomotive, built to replace the finicky and disappointing Cartway between the Docks and the Smeltery. Gronk works. 
'''Big Chicken LLC''' 
All assets and intellectual property have been liquidized and absorbed by Big Chicken LLC. Big Chicken LLC will not be repurchasing distributed shares associated with Chicken, any shareholder invested in Chicken will retain their Chicken shares. Shares in Chicken are not transferable for shares in Big Chicken LLC and will continue to reflect Chicken's financial performance. Following foreclosure, Chicken will not continue to operate and will not re-open. 
'''[[Squalarms|Squalarms-Plant]] Specialist Warehouse''' 
Something about Blue Juice? 
'''The Diet Curtain''' 
Raz made his train smaller. Not as small as Gronk though. 
'''The Studio''' 
A small factory, with [[Lizards' Lodge|recording studio]] on the second floor.

'''Catboy Armaments''' 
Lets make bombs again. 
'''Municipal Pollution Factory''' 
'''Secret Arms Farm''' 
Mad max reference.
Cosy Britain-core vibes

'''Clumpty'''

Little big boy train.

'''The Iron Curtain Propper'''

Big boy train.

'''The Luxe'''

Better big boy train.

'''Oceangoing Decomissioning Vehicle'''

It's not a warship.

'''Taskmaster'''

TASK MASTER!
==Denizens of the Realm==
'''Trevor'''
Lumberjack. He eats sticks. Stonelings don't like him, or any of the others.
'''Roger''' 
He who controls the trains, controls the future. 
'''Mortarmer''' 
Clay? Not clay. Definitely clay!. SAND!<sub>UwU?</sub> 
'''Fishmintzer''' 
Ol' man Fishmintzer the Lighthouse Keeper. (He's actually quite young.) 
'''Archivist''' 
these yuppies, never done a hard day's work in their lives. They just don't know how to graft these days, how to work a trade. Not that they'd be any good at one, what with those soft hands and political opinions. Who even is this new guy anyway, does anyone know his name? 
'''Merlin''' 
There's a strange bot near the railway. he calls himself Merlin.<!--I met a strange bot near the railway; he called himself "Merlin". He told me about his wife, and how he'd do anything to see her smile. She didn't love him, he knew from the start. That bloke at the loan office always had her attention. He reckoned if he just had more income he could afford to make her happy. He saw an ad in the paper, an aristocrat had found new land and was franchising vendors of exotic goods. Apparently he took a loan to get himself on board, but it was all a sham. The new land wasn't, it was connected by land up north. It's ironic really, the same man that took the love of his wife sold him a loan that took his future. He says he lost everything, his wife ran off and cut all ties, taking his son with her. But he thinks his son ended up here, working somewhere close. He wants to find him, but to his son he's a disgrace.--> 
'''BrUwUser'''
Sub. 
'''Root Beer Guy''' 
The goodest henchman. 
'''Curator''' 
Curates the archives and vaults. 
'''Canary''' 
I think it died. 
<!-- ==Controversies==
'''The New World''' 

-->
==Enemies of the State==
'''The Bear''' 
He speaks for the trees, but the trees have roots of lies. He wants nothing more than chaos and ruin. 
'''Chickens''' 
Good for nothin' trouble makers. Always committing arson. 
==Cryptids==
'''Entity''' 
It's gone, we removed it, there's no way it's still around, don't think about it.

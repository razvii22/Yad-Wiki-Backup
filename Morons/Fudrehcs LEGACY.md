=Nuclear Arms Race=

The ''Federal United Republic of the Equal and Happy Citizens of Scrobikia'' was a pair of homeless British dudes living in a hole underneath a big tundra. They believed they could compete against ''[[Kartoshkastrana LEGACY]]'' in achieving world domination and restore the British Empire but were utterly unsuccessful in doing so and just dug a bunch of holes.

==Members==

The two key members of ''FUDRECHS'' wer ''[[People/Scruby LEGACY]]'' (Corporal chief supreme of digging holes and not much else) and ''[[Josh]]'' (mr.Fish).
An internet stranger by the name ''WokeUpLikeThis'' was there at the start but never did anything, and towards the end of ''FUDRECHS'', ''[[People/Tom LEGACY]]'' was forced into joining.

==Achievents==

They got to the moon and then died on the moon.

The ''Federal United Republic of the Equal and Happy Citizens of Scrobikia'' was a pair of homeless British dudes living in a hole underneath a big tundra. They believed they could compete against ''[[Kartoshkastrana]]'' in achieving world domination and restore the British Empire but were utterly unsuccessful in doing so and just dug a bunch of holes.

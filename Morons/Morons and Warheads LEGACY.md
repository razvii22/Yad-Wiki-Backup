== The Morons and Warheads Program ==
<<<<<<< Updated upstream
Highly beneficial tax arrangements were fabricated to incentivise [[Scruby LEGACY]] to form an independent city state while proposals were made to [[Ficko LEGACY|Razvii's lawyer]] explaining how [[Razvii LEGACY|Raz]] could gain diplomatic immunity by starting one himself. 
* The two individuals would be grouped with other team members and deployed to undeveloped locations. 
* Years of hatred and deep rivalry between [[Scruby LEGACY]] and [[Razvii LEGACY]] would provide ideal conditions for a cold war to start, forcing both factions to dedicate their entire attention towards an arms race.

The minecraft M&W locations served as the first somewhat physical and/or metaphysical locations associated with [https://yac.fandom.com/wiki/Yet_Another_Community_Wiki YAC] and have served as a means for the, now defunct, factions of [[Kartoshkastrana]] and [[Fudrehcs]] to play a casual game of thermonuclear hot potato with each other and was the original reason for the M&W discord's existence, despite corporate's incessive need to restructure. -->
=== Kartoshkastrana ===
<<<<<<< Updated upstream
The KK faction was formed by [[Razvii LEGACY|Raz]] and [[Ficko LEGACY]]. Due to the influence of Romanian witchcraft over their ideology, a large part of their weapons development effort was focussed on hunting and taming familiars which they believed to hold great power. The missions became highly controversial when the pair captured a broken familiar capable of manifesting devices from air itself. Ultimately this enabled many shenanigans including but not limited to:  <!--as the both underground and overground means of technological, spiritual, recreational and weapon manufacturing related activities of the KK faction against their rival, and serves as, to this day, the second or third most dangerous location associated with the YAC community due to several hazardous factors such as:-->

* Worryingly deliberate meteoric strikes

* Several, still as of now, missing kinetic warheads
<!-- === Noteworthy events ===
One of [[Razvii]]'s first robotics and heavy weaponry related assigned missions, which would prove a somewhat useful skill in future ventures[[Razvii]]'s almost inexplicable ascent to demigodhood, as the constant contact with hazardous radioactive and anomalous materials seemed to have made him fully impervious to all major sources of damage, including once surviving being thrown into a black hole, explaining his constant assignments to restitch together entire realities and planes of existence, after the elimination of the timeline/reality, some metaphysical reality warping abilities are occasionally observed.[[Ficko]]'s first interaction with [[the yeeter]], a very unoriginally named yet undoubtedly powerful weapon, which is currently very often referenced. One of [[Ficko]]'s first signs of thirst for mechanics and refined oil, trait he has acquired by being Croatian.One of the first times, yet not the only time, a subsidiary or precursor of [https://yac.fandom.com/wiki/Yet_Another_Community_Wiki YAC] has acquired and lost a thermonuclear warhead. -->
===[[Fudrehcs LEGACY]]===
The [[Fudrehcs LEGACY|Federal United Republic of the Equal and Happy Citizens of Scrobikia]] was established by [[Scruby LEGACY]], Brent, and Josh. While initially optimistic about their industrial capacity, they quickly deemed arms development futile in light of Kartoshkastrana's blatantly over powered pet. Their efforts instead were put towards bravely running away in the event that an attack should occur. In upmost secrecy a space program was started to establish a lunar base for such an escape. All secrecy was immediately lost when [[Scruby LEGACY]] announced that he could not breathe on the moon. This was the only accomplishment Fudherhcs made during the program.
<!-- ==Noteworthy events==
[[Fudrehcs]] secretly got to the moon and then suffocated and died on the moon, causing a death message to be revealed in the chat to everyone and revealing that they were secretly on the moon.
Aside from this, [[Fudrehcs]] accomplished nothing of note. -->
===Sub Optimal Outcome===
<<<<<<< Updated upstream
- [ ] Assuming either faction would uphold common sense was a mistake. Fearing no retaliation from [[Scruby LEGACY]], Brent or Josh, [[Razvii LEGACY]] and [[Ficko LEGACY]] became bored and began launching their surplus thermonuclear warheads in any which way just to give themselves something to do.  This was bad.  Constant detonation of incendiary and nuclear weapons caused the atmosphere itself to ignite. In order to survive, both factions were forced to collaborate. Kartoshkastrana pooled their resources with the knowledge and experience of [[Fudrehcs LEGACY]] to start a new space program to escape the now toasty planet. As sea levels rose the group was pushed onto a small island territory. From here they would construct the [[Brazzers IBM|IBM]], an enormous intergalactic cube powered by a carefully moderated blackhole. In their rush to escape, [[Scruby LEGACY]], Brent, [[Razvii LEGACY]], and [[Ficko]] forgot to recover Josh from the moon, where he probably remains to this day.

==[[Fort World LEGACY|Fort World]]==
<div style="text-align: center>''<blockquote>When the world was set alight, to be extinguished by floods, that will be the hardship. Their baptism of fire.</blockquote>''

<div style="text-align: left> After nuclear infernos made the world inhospitable, the last survivors left for space to escape the rising sea levels. In their absence other species were able to take a hold on the world. Extreme environmental pressures forced remaining creatures to evolve and adapt rapidly. Very quickly they learnt to manipulate their surroundings in ways similar to the worlds previous inhabitants.
Centuries passed as the IBM orbited the far outer edges of the solar system, travelling far too quickly for more than a few years to pass on board. Despite approximate preparations and asteroid mining some resources quickly depleted. Wood soon went entirely extinct. Fortunately [[Razvii|Raz]] and [[Scruby]] had spent five minutes considering this possibility and had pre-emptively designed the Mining Craft with atmospheric re-entry capabilities. After moments of careful consideration it was decided that the they and Brent would temporarily return to the world, yank some saplings, then quickly leave. Assuming he possessed a basic level of competence, they allowed [[Razvii|Raz]] to pilot manned [[Brazzers IBM|Mining Craft]] for this operation. <div style="text-align: center><blockquote>'''This was the worst decision.''' </blockquote><div style="text-align: left>[[File:Muppet.mp4]]
===Dark Age===
The world was hostile. Intensely hostile. Immediately requests were made for emergency extraction. However, with the arms race generating no revenue, and the [[IBM]] space program costing such an exorbitant debt, funding the extraction would never be possible. Little information was recorded during that time, but by analysing structures and ruins some understanding of this period can be gained.
[[File:OldKeep1.png|left|400px]]Geography likely aided the survival of [[Scruby LEGACY]], Brent, and [[Razvii LEGACY|Raz]]. At the time of re-entry the world was still flooded. The only land masses above sea level were archipelagos formed of mountain ranges and the occasional plateau. Small peaks surrounded by ocean are easily defensible with minimal need for fortification. Evidence of activity can be found on such a peak just south of the major fortification. Primitive cobblestone construction date this to the earliest days of their survival. Beneath the remains is a network of tunnels that plunge deep into the earth - possibly from early attempts at mining. Given its state of disrepair, its easy to assume that the marooned pair were pushed out of the structure by hostile fauna, however all other nearby structure are much larger in size and would be more challenging to secure; more likely is that the pair left the structure as their needs outgrew its size. The final noteworthy feature of this island is a pair of rings inscribed into the floor. Their purpose is unclear however they are thought to be decorative artwork depicting the orbits of the world and IBM around the sun to preserve the legacy of their past lifestyle and culture.
[[File:BirdsEye1.png|right|400px]]North of the early ruins is a secondary larger landmass. Here stands the best preserved and most heavily fortified structure in the region. Walls surrounding the perimeter of the fort appear to have been expanded multiple times throughout the fort's occupation. The innermost walls housed the forts keep, this was the oldest structure on the island and was used to store all possessions and resources of its occupants. Its thought that the first perimeter expansion was built to secure land that could be used for agriculture. Protected by these walls is evidence of early re-mechanisation, to the north is a windmill,[[File:Farm1.png|left|250px]] while a small farm space west of the keep contains a small waterwheel. Primitive machinery such as this likely developed the groundwork for later industrialization that would come to define the following age. Also within the boundaries of the first outer walls is a pair of inscribed rings, identical to that fund in the earlier ruins, this shared artwork that confirms both structures hare the same inhabitants.  
[[File:Camp1.png|right|350px]] While scholars and historians share a widely accepted understanding of the two fortified structures, there is little agreement on surrounding ruins. Without any artistic inscriptions characteristic of the major fortifications, its hard to tell whether this was part of the defended settlement, a structure built by intelligent fauna, or a remnant of previous inhabitants. Differing materials and construction techniques make it difficult to see a connection with Raz and Scruby's fortifications. Fauna of the time may have been intelligent enough to build encampments, but settling such a close proximity to the fort would never have been possible and there is little other evidence of similar collaboration between fauna.

<<<<<<< Updated upstream
Following a lull in activities within the Morons and Warheads, [[Technicians]], [[Razvii LEGACY]] and [[Brent]] went behind the back of [[Scruby LEGACY]], forming their own "independent" facility without once informing any other [[Technicians]] of this scheme. The controversy would come to light when after a short period of operations, the pair began publicly broadcasting their shenanigans; both parties involved were under the impression that this would go unnoticed and that even when noticed other facility members simply "would not care".  Inevitably [[Scruby LEGACY]] was made aware of this after receiving 4 emails detailing broadcasting from [[Brent]] within the same day. Aditionally, [[Tom]] encountered the broadcast being hosted by [[Razvii LEGACY]] on the first day of their public operations, prompting a shock response and causing alarm within the [[Cellar]] of the [[Yet Another Discord|PR and Management Hub]].

Upon discovering this immense breach of contract, [[Scruby LEGACY]] and [[Tom LEGACY]] immediately began conspiring their infiltration of the server. After more minutes of conspiration than [[Scruby LEGACY]] can count on his hands they decided that not only was their plan rubbish, but that there also never was a contract that could be breached. Despite this, out of pity and pity alone, it was eventually decided by [[Razvii LEGACY]] that the two other members should be permitted entrance to the facility under the condition that they function only as pets. [[Scruby LEGACY]] was later promoted to ''Building Bitch'' and allowed to perform very limited boating duties on [[Industrial/Industrial Lads]]

'''Ficko''' is the one hundred and eleventh iteration of the Croatian lady magnate and the most recent development of the ongoing project. As of right now, the [[Technicians]] responsible for '''Ficko 111''' have failed to develop an entity capable of sparking romance, and with continued success after one hundred and eleven attempts, the are threatening to cut all resources from the programme and discontinue '''Ficko'''.  To justify the maintenance demands of a Croation, '''[[People/Razvii LEGACY]]''' has officially nominated '''Ficko''' as his lawyer and representative in court. We roughly calculate the odds of '''Ficko''' being capable of representing '''[[People/Razvii LEGACY]]''' - even partially - are too small to be worth calculating properly.  In day to day conversation it is typically acceptable for '''Ficko''' to be the punchline of any and all jokes, even when not present. His response to this is little more than ''"Fyuhck"''

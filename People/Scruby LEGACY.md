''Lord_Scruby'' is the callosal pile of tortoise excrement supposedly "in charge" of all this incoherent mess. He is not in any capacity suitable to hold any kind of power and should not be seen as competent.

It is the primary purpose of the ''[[Janitors]]'' to absorb the maddened ramblings of ''Scruby'' and pretend they agree with or at least acknowledge them. They do this sometimes but ''Scruby'' is often too busy being angry about the pointlessness of ''[[Cheddar Cheese]]'', or any number of other idiotic tangents, to notice the failure of his supervisors.

=="Hobbies"==

[[Cheese LEGACY]]. <br />
In order to mitigate the damage he can cause to society as a whole, interests were planted into the mind of ''Scruby'' to make it appear as though he was somewhat human in nature.
Mixing, mastering, and sound engineering is the most prominent of these interests, this has caused ''Scruby'' to pursue education in a local recording studio, with the aspirations of becoming a radio broadcast engineer. Little does he understand that his mission statement gives him just 3.1828134 years of usefulness before he is terminated, thus voiding any ambition.
Additionally, ''Scruby'' has a liking of vehicles, notably and unhealthy obsession with ''[[Triumph Stag]]s''. This is very boring and makes everyone very sad.<br />
Despite efforts to use hobbies as a benign fa√ßade, ''Scruby'' was able to develop ''[[Gardening]]''  as a hobby, thus putting 140% of known humanity at risk of desprongulation at any given moment.

==Great Architecture==
During the many projects and trials conducted in the ''[[Morons and Warheads|Morons And Warheads facility]]'', ''Scruby'' typically is forced into labour as an architect and entirety of construction workforce. His design philosophy is iconic, ambitious, definitive, revolutionary, and overwhelmingly rubbish. Notable pieces of ''Scruby's'' work include ''[[Brazzers IBM]]'' and ''[[Fort World LEGACY|The Fort]]''

''Scruby'' enjoys avoiding taxation from His Majesties Revenue and Customs of Her Majesties Government of Her Majesties United Kingdom of England, Wales, Scotland, and Northern Isles.

Hahhahahaha.
Nope. Don't need that here.
''Scruby'' doesn't do this. All his VAT rebates are legal, sound transaction.
Hahaha LOL

What about all those coffee machines? -[[People/Razvii LEGACY|Raz]]

Shutup, or the ''[[Sheffield - GTA Steal City|Sheffield Coffee Mafia]]'' will come for me. - Scruby

You mean our sales department? -[[Razvii LEGACY|Raz]]

==Diabetes==
''Scruby'' sold the rights to his pancreas to various authorities as a means of payment despite only having 1 pancreas. Very quickly he fell into pancreatic debt and had to declare himself "pancreas bankrupt". This meant sacrificing his pancreas and living the rest of his life having to do hard Insulin and chewing hard Glucose Tablets.


==Twitch==
''Scruby'' Has never streamed.
